# FreedomFood

This console app was created for Assignment One of Mobile App Development.
The goal of this app is to create a platform where users can share meals from restaurants
and attach a tag to them stating if their allergy free or not. 

Within this repository their are two versions of this app, one is accessed and interacted
with through the terminal and the other is through a UI designed with Tornadofx.
